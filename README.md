# passphrase
Random passphrase generator made in Go

I wasn't satisfied with how most password generators (mainly in password
managers) work. Since passwords consisting of words have a higher bitwise value,
and are therefore inherently more secure, it would make more sense to build a
password of arbitrary words.
